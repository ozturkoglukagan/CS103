/* Exercise 1 (use of while loop): Write a program that has a method called digitSum() that accepts an integer parameter and returns the sum of its digits. The program should prompt for non-negative number from the user.

Example: digitSum(29107) returns 2+9+1+0+7 or 19

Hint: Use the % operator to extract a digit from a number (e.g., 13463 % 10 gives us 3)


===========================================================
Exercise 2 (random numbers): Write a program that has a method called "seven" that accepts a Random object as a parameter and uses it to draw up to ten lotto numbers from 1 to 30. If any of the numbers is a lucky 7, the method should stop and return true.  If none of the ten are 7 it should return false. The method should print each number as it is drawn.

Sample output 1:

15 29 18 29 11 3 30 17 19 22 Could not found 7, poor guy!

Sample output 2:

29 5 29 4 7 You found 7! Lucky you!


===========================================================
Exercise 3 (while loop and Random numbers): Write a program that randomly picks a number between 5 and 15. The program should prompt for a number from the user to guess which number is picked by the program. It should print the number of guesses made by the user upon finding the number.



===========================================================
Exercise 4 (Boolean values): Write a program that should have the following methods:

i) hasAnOddDigit(int number) : returns true if any digit of a number is odd.

e.g., hasAnOddDigit(4822116) returns true
e.g., hasAnOddDigit(2448) returns false


ii) allDigitsOdd(int number) : returns true if every digit of a number is odd.

e.g., allDigitsOdd(135319) returns true
e.g., allDigitsOdd(9174529) returns false

iii) hasVowel(String str) : returns true if any char in a String is a vowel.

e.g., hasVowel("eIeIo") returns true
e.g., hasVowel("trkl") returns false

iv) isAllVowels(String str) : returns true if every char in a String is a vowel.

e.g., isAllVowels("eIeIo") returns true
e.g., isAllVowels("oink") returns false

Program should prompt for an integer and string from the user and should use the above methods to see if the given number has an odd digit, and if all the digits are odd; if the given string has a vowel, and if the string has all vowels.



===========================================================
Exercise 5 (while loop, random numbers, conditional execution, booleans): Write a program that plays an adding game. Ask user to solve random adding problems with 2-5 numbers (how many numbers will be added is determined randomly). The user gets 1 point for a correct answer, 0 for incorrect. The program stops after 3 incorrect answers, and prints the total points obtained.

Sample output:
4 + 10 + 3 + 10 = 27 //27 is provided by user
9 + 2 = 11 //11 is provided by user
8 + 6 + 7 + 9 = 25 //25 is provided by user
Wrong! The answer was 30
5 + 9 = 13 //13 is provided by user
Wrong! The answer was 14
4 + 9 + 9 = 22 //22 is provided by user
3 + 1 + 7 + 2 = 13 //13 is provided by user
4 + 2 + 10 + 9 + 7 = 42 //42 is provided by user
Wrong! The answer was 32
You earned 4 total points.
