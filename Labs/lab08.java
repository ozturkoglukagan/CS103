/* exercise 1: Write a program to calculate a Body-Mass Index (BMI). The program should prompt for two people height (in inches) and weight (in pounds). Then, for each person it should print out BMI, and indicate whether that person is underweight, normal, overweight or obese. The program should use static methods to sturcture the solution.

a person is:
underweight if BMI is less than 18.5;
normal if BMI is in between 18.5 and 25;
overweight if BMI is in between 25 and 30;
obese if BMI is greater than 30.

Expected output:
This program reads data for two
people and computes their body
mass index and weight status.

Enter next person's information:
height (in inches)? 67 //170 cm
weight (in pounds)? 176 //80 kg

Enter next person's information:
height (in inches)? 65 //165 cm
weight (in pounds)? 143 //65 kg

Person #1 body mass index = 27.56
overweight

Person #2 body mass index = 23.79
normal

exercise 2: Write a program that counts the letters in a user provided String. The program should prompt for a word.

Type a word: ##Hello!
Letters: 5





======================================================================
exercise 3: Write a program that finds the average of a sequence of numbers, and reports how many of the numbers were negative. The program should prompt for the number of elements in the sequence, and each number in the sequence from a user.

Desired output:
How many numbers do you have? 5
   #1? 3
   #2? -4
   #3? 3
   #4? 8
   #5? -6
average = 0.8
# of negatives = 2

exercise 4: Write a program that calculates the cost of a diner for a set of people. Program should prompt for how many people are at the dinner, and each person's dinner cost. Use static methods to structure the solution

There is a tax to be paid which is 8%, and tip which is 15% of the cost of a diner.

Desired output:

How many people ate? 4
Person #1: How much did your dinner cost? 20.00
Person #2: How much did your dinner cost? 15
Person #3: How much did your dinner cost? 30.0
Person #4: How much did your dinner cost? 10.00

Subtotal: $75.0
Tax: $6.0
Tip: $11.25
Total: $92.25


======================================================================
exercise 5: Write a program that has a method called countFactors() that returns the number of factors of an integer. The program should prompt for the number whose factors will be found.

Desired output:
The number to find its factors? 24
There are 8 factors of 24


// countFactors(24) returns 8 because 
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 are factors of 24.
