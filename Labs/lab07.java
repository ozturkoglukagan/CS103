/* exercise 1: Write a java program that uses a String object, and prints out the length of the string and each character in the string, line by line.
The program should generate following output for string "hello":

Length of the string = 5

0 : h
1 : e
2 : l
3 : l
4 : o


=================
exercise 2: Write a Java program that uses Scanner object to print out user name and age.



=================
exercise 3: Write a Java program that calculates the monthly payment for the Mortgage.
Program needs to use Scanner object to obtain the following:
i) loan amount
ii) number of years
iii) montly interest rate

the montly payment can be calculated by the following formula:
payment = loan amount *  ((c * (1+c)^n) / ((1+c)^n - 1)), where c is montly interest rate, n is the total number of number of months.

The program should generate an output similar to the following (for the given input values):

This program computes monthly mortgage payments.
loan amount	: 275000
number of years : 30
interest rate   : 4.25

monthly payment =  $1352


==================
exercise 4: Write a program that calculate a table for the trajectory of a projectile.
The program needs to use Scanner object to get the following three inputs from the user.

i) "velocity (meters/second)?"
ii) "angle (degrees)?"
iii) "number of steps to display?"


before asking these inputs from the user, the program should give a brief introduction to the user, such as:

"This program computes the
trajectory of a projectile given
its initial velocity and its
angle relative to the
horizontal."

Then, by using inputs obtained by the user, program should generate three outputs at every step: 
i)  x position
ii) y position
iii) elapsed time


Some hints: Java methods use angles in radians, so we need to convert given angle in degree into radian to use java built-in methods.
